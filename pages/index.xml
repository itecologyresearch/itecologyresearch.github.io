The ANTOPTIC (Analysis of trophic network to optimize the delivery of natural pest control services) project, led by SAVE and BioGeCo (INRA), aims to answer main two questions:
1) What are the effects of farming practices and landscape context on the structure of arthropod food webs in vineyards?
2) What is the relationship between the structure of arthopod food webs and the levels of pest control ?</description>

      <description>I am a bio-informatics engineer with a particular expertise in data mining and database development.
Generally speaking, I am interested in everything linked with data mining: management, exploitation and analysis (especially for big volumes of data). I used to work in vegetable genomics, in diverse projects related to data mining, which includes database design (associated with the development of a website), analysis of sequences from NGS techniques (Populus nigra, Pisum sativum), the development of procedure for genome reconstruction (de novo assembly) in the case of small computing resources, and the development of protocols for the selection of SNP which can be applied to genotyping chip.</description>

      <description>I am a quantitative ecologist, with interests ranging from population dynamics or coexistence theory to the statistical analysis of time series.
Most of my research deals with ecological interactions in a dynamic setting (and sometimes a spatially explicit one). Some more details in my personal webpage.
Current projects include time series methods to infer causal relationships, understanding cyclic dynamics in insect pests, and what drives phytoplankton community dynamics.

      <description>Ecological interactions and dynamics of ecosystems
Species interactions, such as predation, competition or mutualism, play a fundamental role in the structuring and dynamics of animal and plant communities. They can strongly affect fluctuations in population size, species relative abundance and ecosystem functioning. Key ecological phenomena, such as pest outbreaks, biodiversity maintenance, trophic cascades are thought to be directly related to ecological interactions. One of our objectives is to measure and predict the effect of those interactions on the dynamics of co-occurring species.</description>

      <description>Our group focuses on population, community and landscape ecology (sometimes blended with other disciplines). We use modelling tools - both statistics and theoretical models - to study ecosystems ranging from forests to the coastal ocean. Most of us are/were affiliated with the University of Bordeaux, within the frame of the Labex COTE, a multi-lab initiative to foster ecological research across ecosystems and disciplines. The ITE group is co-headed by Laure Carassou (INRAE) and Frederic Barraquand (CNRS).</description>

      <description>The ‘BiodiverCité’ project aims at designing guidelines for the preservation of biodiversity in urban landscapes.
The project has four major objectives :
1) quantify biodiversity in the urban and suburban landscapes of the city of Bordeaux. This is done in a multi-taxa framework, using major groups of terrestrial and aquatic fauna, based on historical databases as well as new data collection (groups targeted include butterflies, damselflies, dragonflies, amphibians, fishes)
2) identify conservation priority areas based on known biodiversity and landscape connectivity</description>

      <description>Study zone (Water Streams © BD Cartage ; Wetlands © Adour-Garonne Water Agency ; Superficial water masses © SDAGE) 
In collaboration with Gretha, EPOC and IRSTEA research teams, we aim to characterize the wetland biodiversity of the area of Les Jalles-Blanquefort on the Gironde estuary. We partner with local observatories regarding biological data sets, in an attempt to gather information on both flora and fauna in the area.</description>

      <description>Time series analysis In collaboration with Ifremer Arcachon, we work on phytoplankton community dynamics, especially diatoms (one of the most abundant classes of plankton, actively involved in biogeochemical cycles).
We are particularly interested in:
 Drivers of blooms Coexistence mechanisms  Our research combines long-term data with statistical and theoretical models.
Our analyses of the time series in Arcachon Bay can be found in Barraquand et al. 2018, Oikos. This work has been extended to the French coastline in Picoche et al.</description>

      <description>I am an ecologist with a background in mathematics and informatics applied to biological systems. I used to work on species-specific as well as end-to-end models in applied contexts, mostly in aquatic environments for which I have developed a specific interest.
For the last years, my research has focused on explaining the coexistence of multiple species competing for similar resources. I have tried to find confirmation of already known theoretical mechanisms from field data, and to further theory by analysing the effect of observed processes in more theoretical frameworks.</description>

      <description>I am an ecology modeler working at the interface between biological studies and programming. I focus on mathematical and computer tools to formalize ecological concepts or challenge theoretical models by confronting them to data. My training and, beyond that, my interest are therefore more focused on techniques and problem-solving than on specific ecosystem matters .
This reflects in my background: I have worked on several subjects (shellfish aquaculture, fishery management, plankton community) at different scales (individual-based to end-to-end models), in different places (from South Africa to Berkeley).</description>

      <description>I now work as a project officer for the French Comittee of the IUCN, in charge of the Red List of Ecosystems As a community ecologist, I am keen on investigating the structure of ecological communities as well as their dynamics, so as to understand how they respond to disturbances. I study ecological communities as networks of interactions, trying to capture the architecture of such webs, their variabilities and their dynamics.</description>

      <description>My main research interest is aquatic ecology, mainly fish assemblage dynamics. I have been studying fish in a variety of ecosystems (estuaries, coral reefs or other coastal and pelagic marine environments from Europe, south Pacific, northern Gulf of Mexico, west and south Africa, northwest Indian Ocean). I combine diverse methodological approaches to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of fish populations in the context of climatic and environmental variability (trophic studies based on gut contents, stable isotopes, fatty acids, and/or multivariate statistical approaches).</description>
