      <description>The ANTOPTIC (Analysis of trophic network to optimize the delivery of natural pest control services) project, led by SAVE and BioGeCo (INRA), aims to answer main two questions:
  What are the effects of farming practices and landscape context on the structure of arthropod food webs in vineyards?
  What is the relationship between the structure of arthopod food webs and the levels of pest control ?
  The project combines an experimental and a modeling approach.</description>

      <description>I am a bio-informatics engineer with a particular expertise in data mining and database development.
Generally speaking, I am interested in everything linked with data mining: management, exploitation and analysis (especially for big volumes of data). I used to work in vegetable genomics, in diverse projects related to data mining, which includes database design (associated with the development of a website), analysis of sequences from NGS techniques (Populus nigra, Pisum sativum), the development of procedure for genome reconstruction (de novo assembly) in the case of small computing resources, and the development of protocols for the selection of SNP which can be applied to genotyping chip.</description>

      <description>I am a quantitative ecologist, with interests ranging from population dynamics or coexistence theory to the statistical analysis of time series.
Current projects include time series methods to infer causal relationships, understanding cyclic dynamics in insect pests, and what drives phytoplankton community dynamics.

      <description>Ecological interactions and dynamics of ecosystems
Species interactions, such as predation, competition or mutualism, play a fundamental role in the structuring and dynamics of animal and plant communities. They can strongly affect fluctuations in population size, species relative abundance and ecosystem functioning. Key ecological phenomena, such as pest outbreaks, biodiversity maintenance, trophic cascades are thought to be directly related to ecological interactions. One of our objectives is to measure and predict the effect of those interactions on the dynamics of co-occurring species.</description>

      <description>Our group focuses on population, community and landscape ecology (sometimes blended with other disciplines). We use modelling tools - both statistics and theoretical models - to study ecosystems ranging from forests to the coastal ocean. Most of us are/were affiliated with the University of Bordeaux, within the frame of the Labex COTE, a multi-lab initiative to foster ecological research across ecosystems and disciplines. The ITE group is co-headed by Laure Carassou (INRAE) and Frederic Barraquand (CNRS).</description>

      <description>The ‘BiodiverCité’ project aims at designing guidelines for the preservation of biodiversity in urban landscapes.
The project has four major objectives :
  quantify biodiversity in the urban and suburban landscapes of the city of Bordeaux. This is done in a multi-taxa framework, using major groups of terrestrial and aquatic fauna, based on historical databases as well as new data collection (groups targeted include butterflies, damselflies, dragonflies, amphibians, fishes)</description>

      <description>In collaboration with Gretha, EPOC and IRSTEA research teams, we aim to characterize the wetland biodiversity of the area of Les Jalles-Blanquefort on the Gironde estuary. We partner with local observatories regarding biological data sets, in an attempt to gather information on both flora and fauna in the area. This pilot study aims at gathering diverse disciplines towards a better characterization of wetland functional responses to anthropogenic pressures. The geographical and historical footprint of these pressures on the study wetlands are characterized by diverse approaches including geochemistry, geography, economics and social sciences.</description>

      <description>Time series analysis In collaboration with Ifremer Arcachon, we work on phytoplankton community dynamics, especially diatoms (one of the most abundant classes of plankton, actively involved in biogeochemical cycles).
We are particularly interested in:
 Drivers of blooms Coexistence mechanisms  Our research combines long-term data with statistical and theoretical models.
Our analyses of the time series in Arcachon Bay can be found in Barraquand et al. 2018, Oikos. This work has been extended to the French coastline in Picoche et al.</description>

      <description>This reflects in my background: I have worked on several subjects (shellfish aquaculture, fishery management, plankton community) at different scales (individual-based to end-to-end models), in different places (from South Africa to Berkeley). A special taste for the marine environment has led me to apply a lot of different tools to this environment, but this has not kept me from working on completely theoretical models, or on bioenergy crops. Currently I use autoregressive models and other time series methods to study phytoplankton dynamics.</description>

      <description>As a community ecologist, I am keen on investigating the structure of ecological communities as well as their dynamics, so as to understand how they respond to disturbances. I study ecological communities as networks of interactions, trying to capture the architecture of such webs, their variabilities and their dynamics.
Modeling of community dynamics (numerical simulations and analytical approach), ecological network analysis, and null models are key in my toolbox.
